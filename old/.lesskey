# ## Dvorak key binding swaps.
#
# These preserve the position on the keyboard of the more prominent of key
# bindings for positionally, rather than mneumonically, associated command
# keys.

# ## Dvorak domino-bindings
#
# Some key binding swaps result in inconvenient key maps, e.g. the overriding
# of `t` and `T` for `next-tag` and `previous-tag`.
#
# This section defines key bindings for more convenient key maps, where
# multiple bindings categorized under a single conceptual module are more
# accessibly grouped.

# ### Tags.

# `*` and `#` are analogous, not but too conceptually different for me to feel
# satisfied with using them for tag key bindings in less.

## `\043` refers to `#`.
#*    next-tag
#\043 previous-tag

# Options:
# * -i:         Case insensitive searches iff pattern is all lowercase.
# * -s:         Wrap long lines
# * -c:         Clear screen by repainting, not scrolling.
# * -r (-[rR]): Print all control characters in raw form.
# * -R (-[rR]): Print ANSI (color) escape sequences in raw form.
# * -q (-[qQ]): Don't ring bell on attempts to scroll beyond eof/bog.
# * -Q (-[qQ]): Don't ring bell on any error.
# * -X:         Don't clear screen on exit.  tmux's "alternate-screen" option
#               is recommended as an alternative.
